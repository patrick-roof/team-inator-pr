# Teaminator Team Generator

## Description
This application allows a user to input their teams information, including roles, names, IDs, emails, and role specific traits. It then generates a custom HTML page based on the users input. During this challenge I have learned a lot about object oriented programming, writing files, filter and map functions, and testing.
